# ds-algo-proj-suffixarray
# The goal of this project is to adapt algorithms that sort numbers to the task of sorting all suffixes of a given a string in lexicographic (dictionary) order. 


# Suffix arrays are widely used in fields that deal with sequence data e.g. Natural language processing, bioinformatics, etc --  where they are used for rapid pattern matching.

Limitation: Only accepts strings composed of the characters [a,c,g,t]

SuffixArrayGrp1.java
- Uses Bubble Sort to get the list of sorted suffixes in lexicographical order

SuffixArrayGrp2.java
- Uses Merge Sort to get the list of sorted suffixes in lexicographical order
